BLOWFISH II

BLOWFISH2 Block Cipher encryption source code in C.

The Blowfish2 cipher was released in 2005. It has exactly the same design as Blowfish but has twice as many S tables and uses 64-bit integers instead of 32-bit integers.

It no longer works on 64-bit blocks but on 128-bit blocks like AES. 128-bit block, 64 rounds, key up to 4224 bits.

Very hard security.

Public domain, code free for all even for commercial applications.
